# GroAnalyzer
Tools for analyzing gro trajectory files from molecular dynamics simulations

1. angle - calculate slip angles between adjancent molecules in pi-pi stacked system.

2. op - calculate order parameters of the long-axis and normal directions.

3. rotate - align the molecular assembly to the long-axis and calculate the length and cylindrical radius
